## About This Repository

This repository is a community-driven collection of **Antigravity Workspace Templates**. Our goal is to create a universal, open-source directory of starter kits for various agentic workflows, making it easier for developers to kickstart their projects on the Antigravity platform.

Whether you're building a simple automation agent or a complex multi-agent system, you'll find a template here to get you started.

## What are Antigravity Workspace Templates?

Antigravity Workspace Templates are starter kits for the **Google Antigravity IDE**, designed to streamline the development of autonomous agents. They are optimized for **Gemini 3 Agentic Workflows** and provide a minimal, transparent, and production-grade foundation for building agents.

Think of them as an alternative to more monolithic frameworks like LangChain, offering a more lightweight and flexible approach to agent development.

### Key Features:
-   **Optimized for Gemini 3:** Built to leverage the latest capabilities of Gemini models.
-   **Minimal Architecture:** No unnecessary abstractions, giving you full control.
-   **Production-Grade:** Solid foundation for building real-world applications.
-   **Easy Setup:** Get up and running in seconds with automatic environment configuration.

## Getting Started

To use a template from this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Antigravity-Workspace-Templates.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a template directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Antigravity-Workspace-Templates/template-name
    ```
3.  **Open in a compatible IDE:**
    Open the folder in an IDE like **Google Antigravity** or **Cursor**. The IDE will automatically detect the `.cursorrules` file and set up the development environment for you.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have a template you'd like to share, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a new directory** for your template. Please use a descriptive name (e.g., `web-research-agent`).
3.  **Add your template files** to the new directory. Make sure to include a `.cursorrules` file for automatic setup.
4.  **Add a `README.md`** inside your template's directory explaining what it does and how to use it.
5.  **Open a pull request** to merge your changes into the main repository.

Please ensure your template follows the minimal and transparent philosophy of Antigravity Workspace Templates.
